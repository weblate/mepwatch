          The European Parliament  plays a crucial role in shaping policies
          and laws that affect over 447 million citizens across the European
          Union. Yet, despite its significance, many EU citizens remain unaware
          of how their representatives vote on critical issues. This lack of
          transparency and public awareness undermines democratic
          accountability, fosters political disillusionment, and creates fertile
          ground for extremist parties to exploit misinformation and distrust.
          By increasing transparency and awareness of voting patterns in the EP,
          we can promote accountability, expose contradictions between national
          and European political narratives, and counteract the rise of the far
          right in Europe.
        </p>
        <h4 id="enhancing-accountability">Enhancing Accountability</h4>
        <p>
          Transparency in voting records ensures that Members of the European
          Parliament (MEPs) are held accountable for their decisions. In many
          cases, MEPs vote on legislation that directly impacts their
          constituents, but the complexity of EU governance can obscure how
          these votes align with the interests and promises of national parties.
          When voting records are made easily accessible and widely
          communicated, citizens can evaluate whether their representatives act
          in accordance with their stated platforms and commitments.
        </p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
  Find <a href="/10">all the <b>votes with rollcalls</b> from this term</a> or for <a href="/9>">2019-2024</a> or <a href="/8>">2014-2019</a>
</div>
        <p>
          For instance, increasing access to and awareness of EP votes allows
          citizens to question discrepancies. If an MEP campaigns on climate
          action at home but votes against environmental legislation in the EP,
          constituents can challenge such behaviour. This mechanism of public
          scrutiny incentivises MEPs to act in good faith, aligning their
          actions in Brussels or Strasbourg with their public rhetoric in
          national contexts. A more informed electorate ensures that
          representatives feel the pressure to genuinely represent their voters’
          interests, fostering trust in the political process.
        </p>
        <h4 id="exposing-national-and-european-narrative-contradictions">
          Exposing National and European Narrative Contradictions
        </h4>
        <p>
          Political parties often adopt different narratives at the national and
          European levels. While they might present themselves as
          pro-environment, pro-worker, or progressive in their home countries,
          their votes in the EP may tell a different story. This duality is
          particularly problematic because it allows parties to mislead voters
          while avoiding accountability. By highlighting how national parties
          vote in the EP, discrepancies between their domestic messaging and
          their European actions can be exposed.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, many far-right or populist parties claim to support
          ordinary citizens while frequently opposing worker protections or
          social initiatives in EP votes. Similarly, mainstream parties may
          downplay their complicity in policies that contribute to inequality or
          environmental harm. Exposing these contradictions can help voters
          distinguish between rhetoric and reality, encouraging more informed
          decision-making in elections.
        </p>
        <h4 id="showcasing-genuine-policy-differences">
          Showcasing Genuine Policy Differences
        </h4>
        <p>
          Increased awareness of EP votes can also reveal the substantive
          differences between political parties, helping citizens understand the
          ideological diversity of the European political landscape. Currently,
          low awareness often creates the perception that all major parties are
          essentially the same, fuelling apathy and disenchantment. This
          perception benefits extremist and populist parties, which thrive on
          presenting themselves as the only alternative to an untrustworthy
          establishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          By making voting records more transparent and accessible, it becomes
          easier to show how parties diverge on crucial issues such as climate
          change, labour rights, migration, and digital privacy. Highlighting
          these differences empowers citizens to make choices based on
          substantive policy positions rather than vague slogans or populist
          appeals. It also dispels the myth that the EU is a monolithic
          bureaucracy detached from the diverse political interests of its
          member states.
        </p>
        <h4 id="countering-the-rise-of-the-far-right">
          Countering the Rise of the Far Right
        </h4>
        <p>
          The rise of far-right movements across Europe poses a serious
          challenge to democratic values, social cohesion, and human rights.
          These movements often capitalise on distrust in traditional political
          institutions, spreading misinformation and exploiting voter apathy.
          Increasing transparency and awareness of EP voting records can help
          combat these dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          By exposing how far-right parties vote against measures that benefit
          their constituents—such as social protections, environmental
          safeguards, or anti-corruption measures—voters can see the disconnect
          between far-right rhetoric and action. Furthermore, when mainstream
          parties are held accountable for their voting patterns, it reduces the
          sense of impunity that populist movements often exploit. Transparency
          shines a light on political opportunism and disingenuous behaviour,
          making it harder for extremist parties to manipulate public opinion
          through fearmongering and false promises.

          Practical Steps to Increase Transparency and Awareness
        </h4>
        <p>To achieve these goals, practical steps must be taken:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Publicising Voting Records:</strong> Please use the voting data and interactive datavisualisations on this website an enable your audience 
              to easily track how their representatives
              voted on specific issues.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Fight for more transparency in the plenary:</strong>We have million of plenary votes analysed and visualised, but it's still the minority of votes (the majority is still raised hands, ie. we do not know what each MEP voted). If an upcoming vote matters to you, contact political advisers or MEP in a group to ask them to put it on rollcall
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Fight for more transparency in the committee:</strong>Sadly, the EP doesn't yet publish computer readable rollcalls in the committees, if you have contacts in the EP, ask them to put pressure where they can to fix that.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
          Using the data we have to increase awareness of voting patterns in the
          European Parliament is essential for strengthening democratic
          accountability, exposing political hypocrisy, and showcasing the
          ideological differences that define Europe’s political spectrum. These
          efforts are not only vital for empowering citizens but also for
          countering the rise of the far right, which feeds on misinformation
          and distrust. 
          The stakes for the next European Parliament election could not
          be higher, and transparency is a cornerstone of defending democracy in
          these challenging times.
